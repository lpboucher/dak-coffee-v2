These samples are roasted in a very simple manner to limit the effect, the roast might have on the flavor of the origin. After sample-roasting, we conduct regular cupping sessions. Here, the new origin samples are tasted, and we identify the origins we want to order in larger quantities.\n\nIn order to identify the roast profiles that will eventually go on the shelves, we repeat the process of roasting the selected beans. However, this time we let our creativity run wild and test different combinations of roasting lengths, temperatures and airflow, to create unique roasts for specific beverages.\n\nFinally, a final cupping session with the bean in question, roasted in many different ways, allow us to decide on and finalize the roast profile that best highlight the unique flavor profile of its origin."

Originally from Montreal, Canada, his passion for coffee began during his early years at University, studying and working full-time.\n\nAfter working many years in the Finance and Venture Capital industry, Louis-Philippe decided to make the big move and leave everything behind to follow his passion. Much like with wine and beer, he wants people to discover the breadth and understand the complexity of flavors that coffee can offer.\n\nCoffee philosophy: Louis-Philippe used to be one of those people adding tons of cream and sugar to his coffee. That all changed when he lived in Milan and was introduced to the world of Italian espresso. This experience sparked a journey to discover and appreciate the many ways coffee can be brewed, served and enjoyed. He truly believes that every coffee beverage is unique in its own way and deserves a dedicated roast that celebrates it."

        "text": "<strong>Why you should Always Grind your Coffee before Drinking It</strong><br/><br/>When it comes to specialty coffee, grinding your beans is an important step to achieving the perfect cup. Most coffee experts will agree that you should grind your coffee immediately before brewing it to have the perfect cup. In truth, serious coffee enthusiasts will quickly notice the difference between freshly ground beans and stale “oxidized” versions.<br/><br/><strong>Avoid Pre-Grinding Your Coffee Beans</strong><br/><br/>Ground coffee gets stale much faster than whole beans. Stale coffee lacks the euphoric aroma and flavors that connoisseur lovers strive for. In truth, there are four critical reasons why you should avoid pre-grinding your coffee beans: <br/><br/>Contamination - The oils in coffee are extremely delicate, making them an easy target for contamination. Keep in mind, coffee oil carries the most flavors. Once your coffee is ground, odors that are close by will permeate the bean. Unfortunately, contaminated beans will ruin your whole coffee tasting experience.<br/><br/>Oxygen - Coffee beans contain around 1,000 different coffee tastes and volatile aromas. Once the beans are ground the volatile aromas are immediately released. These volatile compounds react with oxygen in the air (oxidation). It only takes about 15 minutes after the coffee is ground for it to lose about 60% of its aroma and coffee flavor.<br/><br/>Moisture - Coffee oils are water-soluble leaving ground bean vulnerable to moisture and humidity. Moisture will immediately start to dilute the oils in ground beans which destroy the coffee taste. This is why it is very important to store coffee beans in a dry, dark place. In addition, bear in mind that freezing or refrigerating coffee beans is not necessarily a good idea. Extreme changes in temperature can cause condensation to form on the coffee beans.<br/><br/>Depletion of CO2 - Increased surface area allows for more carbon dioxide (CO2) gas release. During the roasting process, a lot of CO2 is created. Since the bean is porous, some of the CO2 is dissipated while the bean is cooling. However, a lot of CO2 is retained within the cells of the coffee bean. Keep in mind that the release of CO2 is what creates the essential oils (aroma and flavor) in the coffee. When there is a greater surface area such as with ground coffee, a much greater amount of CO2 gas is released. Actually, within 1 minute after grinding the whole bean, 80% of the gas is released into the air. Wait to long after grinding and you will lose the coffee flavor that is desired.<br/><br/>Tasting Notes: The solution for the best coffee is to always grind your coffee beans just before brewing. In all conscience, you should never pre-grind your coffee beans if you want specialty coffee.<br/><br/><strong>The Right Grinder</strong><br/><br/>There are two types of grinders for home use, the common bladed grinder and the burr grinder. The common bladed grinder has a two-sided single blade that spins and chops the beans. Unfortunately, this type of grinder can be very inconsistent. The common bladed grinder has no grind settings and can burn your coffee, potentially destroying the flavor. In truth, a low-quality grinder will make tiny coffee fragments known as fines. The fines extract rather quickly which cause a bitter flavor from over-extraction. A cheap grinder can also cause boulders, large pieces that do not fully extract. Boulders will create a sour flavor.<br/><br/>The burr grinder or coffee mill uses two burs (serrated discs). You can easily set the desired grind then load the chamber with whole beans to start grinding. Unlike the common bladed grinder, the ground coffee collects in a second chamber. In addition, the burr grinder has a very consistent grind without chunks and pieces of whole bean. If you do not have a quality grinder then it may be best to use pre-ground beans for the best coffee. Generally, you can find a quality grinder at a coffee shop or local roaster. However, if you love a smooth and delicious cup of coffee then you may want to consider purchasing a quality grinder.<br/><br/><strong>The Correct Grind</strong><br/><br/>Grinding your coffee before drinking it will always create the best coffee flavor. The freshness and flavor of the brew are also dependent on the grind. How the water is absorbed is paramount to the type of grind.<br/><br/>Ideally, you also want the right ground for the type of brew that is anticipated or desired. For example, for espresso, it is crucial that you use a very fine and consistent grind. A good indicator for the perfect espresso shot is the center of the pinch. The coffee should slightly clump together. If it does not clump, then your grind is not fine enough. If there is excessive clumping, then the grin is to fine. In fact, too fine a grind will cause over-extraction and a bitter taste. Just remember, making a specialty coffee like espresso requires balancing a number of factors – the grind, type of coffee, tamp and pressure. The coffee grind will determine the strength and richness of the brew. The grind is in accordance with the type of machine that you use. For instance:<br/><br/>Very fine grind – this grind is mostly used for Espresso drinks<br/>Fine Grind – a grind mainly for Pour Over methods such as a Melitta or an Aeropress\nMedium Grind - this grind is recommended for Drip Coffee<br/>Coarse Grind – a coarse grind is for a French Press and Percolators<br/><br/>Espresso – a very fine grind is used when making espresso. This method of brewing takes some practice but is worth the effort for a strong and flavorful cup of coffee.<br/><br/>Pour Over – for a pour over device such as a Melitta, a fine grind is recommended. A fine grind will slow the brewing process giving the hot water a chance to absorb the flavors. To course a grind will result in a weak cup of coffee. A fine grind is recommended for the Pour Over method to slow down the brewing time. You also want to pause between pours so that the hot water has a chance to seep. Make sure to not let the grind dry out between pours.<br/><br/>Drip Coffee – – a medium grind is used with the drip method. This is because the filter inside helps retain some of the water while it is brewing. Some coffee connoisseurs will use a fine grind with the drip method for a stronger cup of coffee. However, a fine grind is not essential for a more robust cup of coffee.<br/><br/>French Press – you use a coarse grind with a French Press because it makes it easier to push down the coffee screen. A course grind will produce a full-bodied coffee with minimal sediment. Tasting Notes: Too fine a grind will result in a lot of sediment and coffee grounds.<br/><br/><strong>Keep Your Grinder Clean</strong><br/><br/>Generally, a burr grinder will reserve several ounces of coffee in the burrs. In fact, the larger the grinder the more coffee it reserves. This is generally not an issue at a coffee shop because the grinder is used quite often throughout the day. However, it can become a problem for home users as the old ground beans will become stale and affect the flavor of your coffee. Therefore, it is imperative that you keep your grinder as clean as possible. An easy and quick method of cleaning is to run instant rice through the machine.<br/><br/><strong>The Ideal Cup of Coffee</strong><br/><br/>Without a doubt, the best coffee is made when you grind your coffee before making it. Likewise, selecting the right grind that corresponds to your method of brewing is essential. Following the basic guidelines (when to grind your coffee beans and using the correct grind for your device), you result in the perfect brew with superior taste.",
