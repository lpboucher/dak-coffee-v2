These samples are roasted in a very simple manner to limit the effect, the roast might have on the flavor of the origin. After sample-roasting, we conduct regular cupping sessions. Here, the new origin samples are tasted, and we identify the origins we want to order in larger quantities.\n\nIn order to identify the roast profiles that will eventually go on the shelves, we repeat the process of roasting the selected beans. However, this time we let our creativity run wild and test different combinations of roasting lengths, temperatures and airflow, to create unique roasts for specific beverages.\n\nFinally, a final cupping session with the bean in question, roasted in many different ways, allow us to decide on and finalize the roast profile that best highlight the unique flavor profile of its origin."

Originally from Montreal, Canada, his passion for coffee began during his early years at University, studying and working full-time.\n\nAfter working many years in the Finance and Venture Capital industry, Louis-Philippe decided to make the big move and leave everything behind to follow his passion. Much like with wine and beer, he wants people to discover the breadth and understand the complexity of flavors that coffee can offer.\n\nCoffee philosophy: Louis-Philippe used to be one of those people adding tons of cream and sugar to his coffee. That all changed when he lived in Milan and was introduced to the world of Italian espresso. This experience sparked a journey to discover and appreciate the many ways coffee can be brewed, served and enjoyed. He truly believes that every coffee beverage is unique in its own way and deserves a dedicated roast that celebrates it."

These flavors become stale 30 minutes after being ground, therefore, it would not be possible to fully enjoy our product if we were to send grounded coffee. You can read about the importance of grinding coffee before extracting it or brewing it here."

Our coffee portfolio changes on a seasonal basis depending on the different harvests and climates to offer you the best quality.

                        "answer": "As coffee is an international product grown in tropical areas, we unfortunately can’t grow coffee locally in The Netherlands. However, we partner with local coffee importers (90% of the coffee arriving in Europe lands in The Netherlands or in Germany, reducing transport emissions between importers and our storage) We are ready to pay a premium price for our green coffee beans to make sure everyone in the supply chain gets their fair shares and our customers get the best quality. We are hoping to open direct trade relationships with farmers in 2020 by visiting the farms ourselves, assessing their conditions and developing exclusive partnerships. It is also in our short-term plan to give back to the coffee community and invest in projects that can improve living conditions for the farmers."

We are proud to partner with a supplier that invests in CO2-reducing projects in coffee growing countries, so the greenhouse gas emissions needed to produce coffee bags can be compensated by reducing emissions elsewhere. Our shipping boxes are also 100% recyclable and made of recyclable materials and water-based ink making them environmentally friendly. Our goal is to continuously improve our processes in order to reduce our footprint. After all, we only have one planet."

The result is a better utilization of assets (roasters, warehouse space, etc.) and lower emissions (as compared to all participants having their own office)"
