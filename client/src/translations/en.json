    "intro": "Dak Coffee Roasters is based in charming Amsterdam, Netherlands and was founded by two Canadians from Montreal. We select beautiful and unique coffees and carefully roast them to highlight the best flavors they have to offer. We always maintain a selection that includes some funky and experimental coffees along with more classic origins. There is always something to be found, no matter your preferences.",

        "description": "Hello! This is us, the duo behind Dak Coffee Roasters. Originally from Montreal, Canada, we have been roaming around Europe for over 8 years now. We have lived in different cities and we finally ended up settling in Amsterdam. We are a small team of six, so we handle every order with care and with a personalised touch.<br>Coffee has always been part of our lives, although our love for specialty coffee has grown exponentially in the past few years. After working many years respectively in Finance & Marketing, we decided to pursue our dream, opening a coffee roastery. Dak was born from true passion for coffee and the desire to embark on a journey of endless discoveries.<br>We select our coffees based on their unique tasting profiles and of course that are 100% fully traceable. We partner with importers that share our values and we roast each one of our coffees carefully to bring the best flavours they have to offer.<br>Coffee is supposed to be a positive moment in everyone’s daily life, specialty coffee might sound pretentious or exclusive, but we feel everyone should be able to drink specialty coffee so adding fun to all of this is what we are about.<br>Louis-Philippe & Veronique"

      "description": "We often forget where the things we consume come from, but let us tell you that good coffee tastes even better when it is sourced ethically! We only partner with importers that share our values, work with exclusive lots and do extensive background research on the farms. We are ready to pay a premium price for our green coffee beans to make sure everyone in the supply chain gets their fair share and our customers get the best quality.<br>To make sure our customers can find something they like based on their preferences, but also try something new, we always maintain a selection that includes some funky and experimental coffees along with more classic origins.<br.Fore more information on that - visit our sustainability page."

    "roasting": {
      "title": "Roasting",
      "description": "We believe the only way to identify unique flavors is to continually try new and innovative roasting profiles, but also to remain open-minded about new innovations in processing methods, emerging coffee origins and new discoveries in coffee varietal genetics.<br>We roast on an IMF machine that provides a high degree of control and consistency in our roasts. The machine uses a convection system that allows to properly develop coffees in a shorter time. The result is clean, bright and sweet coffees."

When it comes to sourcing, we’ve selected importers and exporters who share the same vision and values as us.<br>In Europe, we partner with the following importers: Nordic Approach, The Coffee Quest and Typica Europe.<br>For exporters, we work with Cultivar in Peru, Primavera in Guatemala, Cata Export in Colombia, Agricafe in Bolivia. The value added by working with these importers and exporters are that they have the capacity and expertise to sustain relationships with producers, to import coffee to Europe with their knowledge on logistics and above all, they are transparent about their pricing."

    "packaging": {
      "title": "Coffee packaging",
      "description": "As many of you noticed, we changed our packaging in 2022 to boxes. Although this change was not in our initial plan, we decided to move forward with this packaging for several reasons.<br>Once our current stock of 100% recyclable bags is finished, we are looking into producing bags that are smaller, using less material and having the most sustainable material used for coffee bags (while keeping optimal freshness and being food safe). Using boxes allow us to reduce 2 labels / bag (the roast level label and the date label). We are moving to stamps that are easier to use on paper.<br>The paper we decided to use for our boxes is Fuego Matt from Papyrus who also has sustainability in mind and environmental certifications.<br>For local wholesale customers, we offer the possibility to pack coffee in reusable buckets. If you are located in Amsterdam and interested in this scheme, let us know!"

    "waste": {
      "title": "Coffee Waste",
      "description": "As quality of the green coffee we buy and the quality of the roast we produce are key to our business, we go through testing before releasing every single coffee. This means we can conduct many test roasting batches before we are fully satisfied with the final roast.<br>The test batches never make it to our customers but instead, we blend them all together and put them in kg bags that are then sold on toogoodtogo at cost price. We’ve sold 793kg of coffee this year through the platform, a win-win for everyone."

  "showroom": {
    "intro": "Our showroom is located in the industrial park of Nieuwendammerdijk in Amsterdam Noord next to the roastery.<br>The initial idea of the showroom was to have a dedicated space for our team to do some cuppings and meetings. However, being solely a roastery doesn’t allow us to connect directly with people like a cafe does, so we wanted to have this space to further connections with our customers and partners. We therefore open our showroom doors every week for a few hours for people to come in, taste some coffees and have access to our full retail selection.<br>The showroom was also designed to host coffee-related events such as workshops, seminars and cuppings. You will find below the calendar of upcoming events.",
